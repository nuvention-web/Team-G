            <p> Analyzing and gaining a better perspective of our user space is the current focus of the team. Eliciting required information from prospective users will help in building a system that is more aware of the user's needs. We are also brainstorming on all the functionalities the system should support in tandem. </p>

            <p> Through the course, we wish to develop and bring a product to market, learn all the pitfalls involved in entrepreneurship along the way and hopefully have a successful business up and running in the future. We would also like to network and build connections so as to leverage them in any future ventures that we might embark on. </p>

            <p>Our product spaces include home cooked food and perhaps food delivery services. We're looking for a way to commodify home cooked food within a community. Depending on insights gained from interviews, we might look into incorporating a delivery service too. </p>
            <p>Our main customers are people who cook at home, and people who want the convenience of take-out and the satisfaction of a tasty, healthy meal. The community in Evanston would be our Beachhead market. Of course, depending on the insights we gain from our interviews about customer priorities, our customer focus might shift. </p>
